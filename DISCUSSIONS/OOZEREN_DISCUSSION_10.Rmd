# Exercise 8
A certain calculating machine uses only the digits 0 and 1. It is supposed to transmit one of these digits through several stages. However, at every stage, there is a probability p that the digit that enters this stage will be changed
when it leaves and a probability $q = 1 - p$ that it won't. Form a Markov chain to represent the process of transmission by taking as states the digits 0 and 1. What is the matrix of transition probabilities?

# Solution
If we wanted to visualize how the machine works:

$X_1 \to \text{STAGE 1} \to X_2 \to \text{STAGE 2} \to X_3 \to \text{STAGE 3} \to x_4 \to \cdot\cdot\cdot$

At each stage (or step), $X_i$ can take on one of two values (or states): $S = \{0, 1\}$.

The transition matrix will be

\[
P = 
\begin{pmatrix}  
q & p \\
p & q
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 - p & p \\
p & 1 - p
\end{pmatrix}
\]
